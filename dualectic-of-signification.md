  This project proposes a semiological framework for analyzing meaning-making processes across cognitive, symbolic, and societal domains. It explores the irreducible distinction between dual and dialectical oppositions, arguing for a plural and domain-specific theory of signification grounded in linguistic structures.

# The Dualectic of Signification  
## Toward a Semiological Foundation for Social Theory

Summary
<p align="justify">
The point of departure for this project is a philosophical dispute concerning the validity and limits of metaphysics—particularly the ontological distinction between entities (the ontic) and the structures or conditions that make them intelligible (the ontological). This dispute, already present in the early correspondence between Wilhelm Dilthey and Edmund Husserl, centers on whether any general metaphysical system can coherently account for the multiplicity of human experiences. Husserl, rejecting both Kant’s noumenon and Spinoza’s rationalist system, proposes a phenomenology that focuses not on fixed essences or metaphysical absolutes, but on the structures of intentional consciousness that render phenomena meaningful. He clearly distinguishes between the ontic (concrete entities in the world) and the ontological (the essential, a priori conditions of their appearance in consciousness), and advocates for a multiplicity of irreducible modes of experience—cognitive, ethical, aesthetic—each governed by its own internal logic and validity. Heidegger, by contrast, blurs this distinction through his concept of Dasein—a being that is at once existential, finite, and historical, but also the ground of all possible ontological understanding. This move, while claiming to overcome classical metaphysics, risks reintroducing a new kind of mystified metaphysics: a monistic abstraction in which all modes of being are subsumed under a fundamental structure of Being itself. The result is a suppression of pluralism: the diversity of existential levels, interpretive attitudes, and symbolic formations that constitute human reality.
To address this limitation, we turn to certain philosophical methodologies that share a critical stance toward ontological foundationalism. Adorno's negative dialectics, Lefebvre's concept of double determination, and Althusser's notion of overdetermination each attempt, in different ways, to destabilize totalizing metaphysical frameworks. What unites these approaches is their anti-systemic impulse and their interest in relational structures that operate at a meta-level—structures that are not ontological in the classical sense, but methodological and symbolic. However, while these theories gesture toward a linguistic or symbolic reconfiguration of ontological problems, they stop short of fully committing to this shift. It is here that our proposal intervenes: by relocating these problems onto semiological terrain, we seek to address them using tools drawn from linguistics and semiotics. In this framework, general forms of structural or symbolic determination are treated not as metaphysical categories, but as relations of signification—that is, as historically and materially situated processes of meaning-making.
Many interpretations of Saussure's work refer to his so-called “antinomies,” assuming that his distinctions—between langue and parole, synchronic and diachronic, syntagmatic and paradigmatic, signification and value—function as dichotomous oppositions or inherent contradictions. However, this perspective often misrepresents the nature of these distinctions. Rather than true antinomies, most are better understood as dualities. Whereas dialectical oppositions operate through negation, conflict, and exclusion, dual oppositions are symmetrical and reciprocal: one term reflects, presupposes, or contains the other. This dual structure is especially evident in the syntagmatic/paradigmatic relationship, which Saussure identifies as the core mechanism of language. In contrast, distinctions such as langue/parole or synchronic/diachronic appear more dichotomous and sometimes function as homologous axes. Thinkers like Barthes not only align these two axes, but also place the paradigm/syntagm distinction on the same conceptual plane. In doing so, they overlook the simultaneity of syntagm and paradigm across both langue and parole, and lose sight of Saussure's combinatorial mechanism of language—replacing it with a different logic, or attempting to impose a stricter one where Saussure's remains deliberately fluid. This classificatory view of language as a binary mechanism contrasts sharply with Jakobson’s perspective, which tends to emphasize symbolic aspects. Jakobson, while instrumental in extending Saussurean insights to the semiological and cultural realms, often reduces linguistic processes to their discursive and semantic dimensions, and later to figurative or expressive ones—thus minimizing language's role as a formal, combinatorial, and differential system. While we value Jakobson’s contribution in expanding linguistic mechanisms into symbolic and aesthetic domains—those linked to imagination, dreams, metaphor, and artistic expression—it is equally crucial to address their cognitive-rational and societal-instrumental dimensions. These are more closely aligned with the linguistic sign than with the symbol, and concern the more abstract, systematic, and operational functions of language.
Our thesis is that the duality between syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations is not merely a feature of language, but a structural principle underlying all processes of signification. This duality manifests across different levels of experience and interaction—from the intrapsychic (between imaginative and rational faculties), to the intersubjective (between symbolic-communitarian and rational-societal relations). Yet it would be a mistake to assume that this duality is governed by a single abstract form that unfolds uniformly across domains. Each level—imaginary, symbolic, rational, social—possesses its own structures, principles, and logic. There is no metaphysical ground or teleological development that unifies them. Rather, we observe a plurality of structural dualities, each irreducible to the others. In this sense, language—understood semiologically—serves as a model for apprehending the diversity of meaning-making processes without reducing them to a single form, logic, or origin. 
We do not merely identify dual oppositions within each of these domains; we also examine dialectical oppositions, asserting that these two modes of opposition—often confused or ambiguously defined—are irreducible to one another. Beginning with the rational-cognitive domain, we observe dialectical structures such as tautology and antinomy, affirmation and negation, alongside a fundamental duality between unity and difference, synthesis and analysis, intuitive abstraction and analytical reasoning. These mechanisms correspond to cognitive functions, instrumental reason, hypothetical-deductive logic, and the mathematical structures that serve adaptation, knowledge production, and scientific understanding. In the imaginary domain, the dialectic appears between figuration and defiguration, or “presentification” and transfiguration, while the duality operates between fascination and fantasy, condensation and displacement, metaphor and metonymy—processes tied to desire, the unconscious, dreamwork, and artistic expression. In the symbolic-communitarian domain, we find dialectics of inclusion and exclusion, identity and alterity, evident in the dynamics of ethnogroup and exogroup, the master-slave relation, and the problem of double contingency. The duality here arises in the opposition between segmentation mechanisms (gift exchange, totemic culture, mimesis, metaphor) and distinction mechanisms (status groups, honor, castes, prestige—linked to metonymy). Finally, in the societal-political domain, we encounter dialectics between individual and society, autonomy and alienation, freedom and structural coercion—manifest in ideological and normative discourses. Duality, in this context, appears in the rationalizing mechanisms of functional differentiation, technical specialization, and the centralization of control, coercion, and production in impersonal bureaucratic structures. Across all these domains, we find that dialectical and dual oppositions operate under distinct principles, each irreducible to the other, and that their replication within each field follows the specific logic, structure, and internal dynamics proper to that domain.
