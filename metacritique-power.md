Metacritique of Power: Power Relations and Structures of Domination

This research explores the nature, foundations, and structures of power from a critical-political perspective. It starts by examining power as a sui generis social relation—irreducible to coercion, violence, or legitimacy—and investigates how various intellectual traditions differentiate between power, domination, and authority.
The work is divided into two main parts. The first focuses on the fundamental elements and institutions that shape power relations: social groups, elites, organizations, and the apparatuses of domination. It maps how power becomes institutionalized in various forms of the state, connected to modes of production and social types.
The second part delves into the long-standing debate on the autonomy of the state. It compares two traditions: the pluralist-institutionalist perspective and the Marxist-postmarxist view. Through a systematic review of classical sociology, functionalism, structuralism, and critical theory, the study reconstructs how each tradition conceptualizes the state—as actor, system, apparatus, or field—and how they address the question of its autonomy.
The concluding section brings the discussion into the present, addressing how global capitalism, algorithmic governance, and platform economies reshape the power of the nation-state and configure new forms of accumulation and regulation. It questions the role of techno-corporations and financial mechanisms in emerging post-democratic or techno-feudal scenarios.
