# **Political Representation and Mass Democracy**
### *Crisis of Representation in the Cybernetic Era*

**Summary**  
<p align="justify">
This research investigates the evolution of political representation within mass democracy, tracing its formation alongside the rise of public opinion, the press, and mass culture, and examining the transformations brought by the internet, social media, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. The central hypothesis is that the legitimation system of modern democracies harbors an inherent, cyclical tendency toward crisis—comparable to the internal contradictions of the economic system. Rather than mitigating the structural tensions of mass democracy, contemporary digital-cybernetic technologies have exacerbated them, intensifying a cyclical drift between two extremes: on one side, civic withdrawal, apathy, and a shrinking, self-validating private sphere — one that algorithms reinforce by tailoring content to individual bias; on the other, emotionally manipulated forms of political activism, subordinated to algorithmic propaganda machines. These technologies accelerate the crisis of legitimacy by dissolving the boundaries between persuasion and deception, public and private, truth and falsehood — fostering both a hyper-fragmented public sphere and new mechanisms of emotional control and symbolic domination.
